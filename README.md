Designing a website for local bakery in Jammu

Here's is a cool webpage designed using:

- [x] HTML5
- [x] CSS3
- [x] FLEXBOX
- [x] Media Queries
- [x] Little Bit of JavaScript Queries to fetch images using a simple loop


#### So, it's basically a simple attempt to apply my Front-End concepts in a better way to design something practical and what else can suit this sole purpose better than designing a showcase website for some business.
